## üìù Quicknote

This is a very hacky project to bulk upload to shopify . Supports all the Basic features - but has a few knacks here and there -

 * Error Reporting not implmented 
 * HSN codes should be accurate - else would not be added 
 * 2 Images should be uploaded for each product to make image uploading work ( can be changed and updated as you like in the code) 
 * Meta title and description picked up from the title and body of the product   
 * You shop URI should be added to the config, the settings SHOP URL doesn't work for now.

Feel free to submit issues , if you get stuck somewhere . Would be more than happy to help . Cheers !
